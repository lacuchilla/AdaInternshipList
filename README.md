# AdaInternshipList
Rails Project for Ada Developers Academy

This is the Thanksgiving break project for Ada Developers Academy started at the Facebook Women's Student Hackathon.

I created a database with the names, locations, descriptions, and websites of all of the sponsor companies for cohort[3]. Users are able to add, edit, delete or view any of the companies. Once a user has chosen a specific company, they are able to view, add, update, and delete contacts for that company.

I see this site as the basis for an Ada Student Dashboard. Ada staff would have admin rights and be able to have control over adding, editing, and deleting the companies on the list as well as add at least one contact person for each company. Students would be able to add contacts as they network with individuals from each company.
